            <p>
                In this project, CAPTCHA was presented as a measure for secure human-computer interaction. A
                multi-factor CAPTCHA scheme that integrates facial recognition and real-time functionality as a
                secure
                verification mechanism to check the activities of bots that try to assume human status was designed,
                developed, and tested. The real-time functionality is premised on the human user's ability to
                complete
                trivial tasks which though simple for human is difficult to break by bots. This was motivated by the
                need to combat attackers' tendencies to beat existing CAPTCHA schemes through optical character
                recognition, image annotation, tag classifier, etc. Literature on a number of existing schemes was
                reviewed with a view to identifying gaps and establishing the research agenda. The system design and
                analysis were done using scalable design techniques. Implementation was done using Javascript and a
                set
                of APIs. The scheme was tested on an intel core i7 3GHz computer and further evaluated. Preliminary
                results and findings show a promising effectiveness and efficiency of the developed system.

            <p>
                Over the years, electronic mail (e-mail) has been the target of several malicious attacks. Phishing is
                one of the most recognizable forms of manipulation aimed at e-mail users and usually, employs social
                engineering to trick innocent users into supplying sensitive information into an imposter website.
                Attacks from phishing emails can result in the exposure of confidential information, financial loss,
                data misuse, and others. This paper presents the implementation of a maximum entropy (ME) classification
                method for an efficient approach to the identification of phishing emails. Our result showed that
                maximum entropy with parsimonious feature space gives a better classification precision than both the
                Naïve Bayes and support vector machine (SVM).

            <p>
                Agriculture has become the bedrock of some growing economy in the world but the discovery of crude oil
                and other resources in a developing country like Nigeria has led to the extreme decline in the practice.
                Many youths now have either low or no interested in agriculture and the majority of the people that are
                actively practicing are the older generation. This study revisits the impact of education on students
                interest in agriculture as a professional career. The study was carried out in an agriculture-based
                uni-versity with a state of the art equipment. Our findings show that 64% of agricul-ture students who
                participated in this survey are willing to pursue agriculture-related careers. Likewise, there is a
                significant relationship between the student’s gender and farm ownership, with 84% of male students
                likelier to own farms. Also, our results have shown that students in higher levels have more interests
                in agriculture …
